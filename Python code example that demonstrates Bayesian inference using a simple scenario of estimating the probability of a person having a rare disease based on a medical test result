# Define prior probability: P(Disease)

probability_negative_given_no_disease = 0.90  # 90% true negative rate

# Calculate the complement probabilities for P(Negative Test | Disease) and P(Positive Test | No Disease)
probability_negative_given_disease = 1 - probability_positive_given_disease

# Define the evidence: P(Positive Test)
# Use the law of total probability to calculate it based on the prior and conditional probabilities
evidence = (prior_probability_disease * probability_positive_given_disease) + ((1 - prior_probability_disease) * (1 - probability_negative_given_no_disease))

# Apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability: P(Disease | Positive Test)
posterior_probability_disease = (prior_probability_disease * probability_positive_given_disease) / evidence
